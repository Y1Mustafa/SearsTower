Main Menu:

The program prompts the user to choose between two options:
Option 1: Display your original graphic.
Option 2: Display the Sears Tower.
Sears Tower:

If the user selects the Sears Tower, they are prompted to input a size (minimum of 2). Based on the size, the program generates the tower using ASCII characters.
The Sears Tower has three vertical sections (top, middle, and bottom) and three horizontal sections (left, center, and right). The center section is the tallest, followed by the left, and then the right. The size input determines the height of each section.

Formatting requirements include pipes (|), underscores (_), pound signs (#), and equal signs (=) for ground and utility floors. The horizontal sections are two characters wide.
The program must match the example format exactly, with correct spacing and placement of characters.

Original Art:
If the user selects your original art, the program will display an ASCII creation of your design. The original art must:
Be between 5 and 80 lines long.
Not exceed 100 characters in width.
Use at least one loop in its generation.
Be unique from the Sears Tower design and should not require user input (though optional input can be commented out).
